# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-26)

**Core value:** Dougal can free an OP-Z slot knowing the complete song can be verified and restored later.
**Current focus:** Milestone complete

## Current Position

Phase: Not started (defining requirements)
Plan: —
Status: Defining requirements
Last activity: 2026-08-30 — Milestone v1.2 started

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table. Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: One captured source identity and immutable byte buffer define the transaction boundary; source loss stops without fallback substitution.
- Phase 1: Archives publish only after atomic reread, byte comparison, parse, SHA-256/length evidence, and final source revalidation.
- Phase 1: Failed or corrupt archives remain visible only as sanitized, restore-ineligible diagnostics.
- Phase 5: Synthesized split halves remain restore-ineligible until their recorded device acceptance check passes.
- Phase 6: Automatic clearing is enabled only because the delete-project-file method passed fixture and complete physical-device checks; manual clearing remains the fallback.
- [Phase 2]: Schema 1 stores only bounded public metadata, sanitized provenance, and current-byte project/snippet/whole-grid evidence.
- [Phase 2]: Project verification, archive completeness, restore eligibility, and manual-free eligibility remain independent derived facts.
- [Phase 2]: Manual-free eligibility is recomputed from complete stored evidence and exact fresh mounted slot bytes on every read.
- [Phase 2]: Phase 2 keeps all undocumented post-clear representations unclassified; confirmed-empty evidence remains Phase 6 work.

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- None. The synthesized half passed auditory comparison and exact recovery; the proven delete-project-file method is enabled by its bounded acceptance record.

## Deferred Items
